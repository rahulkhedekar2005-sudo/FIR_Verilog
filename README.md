# FIR_Verilog
# FIR Digital Filter Design Using Verilog

This project implements a FIR digital filter using Verilog HDL and verifies its output through software-based simulation.

## Tools Used
- Icarus Verilog
- GTKWave
- MATLAB

## Description
The FIR filter is implemented using fixed-point arithmetic and tested using a Verilog testbench. The output is verified against MATLAB simulation results.

## How to Run
1. Compile using Icarus Verilog
2. Run simulation
3. View waveform in GTKWave
